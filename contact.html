                            schools. Going to school during the day and cranking on design work at
                            night. Not only was I learning the basics of quality programming during
                            my classes, but I was also understanding what it meant to run a business
                            in the outside world.

                            necessity, mixed with solid design is what gets me going every day.

                        <h2>What is Hacking?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Computers have become mandatory to run a successful businesses. It is
                            not
                            enough to have isolated computers systems; they need to be networked to
                            facilitate communication with external businesses. This exposes them to
                            the
                            outside world and hacking. Hacking means using computers to commit
                            fraudulent acts such as fraud, privacy invasion, stealing
                            corporate/personal
                            data, etc.
                            <br><br><br>
                            Cyber crimes cost many organizations millions of dollars every
                            year. Businesses need to protect themselves against such attacks.
                            Hacking is identifying weakness in computer systems or networks to
                            exploit
                            its weaknesses to gain access. Example of Hacking: Using password
                            cracking
                            algorithm to gain access to a system <br><br><br>
