                                        <p>My name is Nabek Abebe,first year software engineering student at Addis Ababa
                                            Institute of Technology.I had the interest of taking software
                                            class since the age of 12 but it was late in my teen's that i actually got
                                            something to do about it. i started taking video tutorials and practice
                                            my coding skills.I have dedicated my life on improving my coding skill
                                            since.My work paid off and now I am a software engineering student
                                            in the the highest standard university in Ethiopia,Addis Ababa University.
                                            In my spare time I develop websites for individuals and companies
                                            such as school.
                                            <p>
                                                I moved on to study the software engineering in Addis, and began to grow
                                                my network.developing websites and branding work for friends and
                                                schools. Going to school during the day and cranking on design work at
                                                night. Not only was I learning the basics of quality programming during
                                                my classes, but I was also understanding what it meant to run a business
                                                in the outside world.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I love what I do. The combination of business goals, mixed with human
                                                necessity, mixed with solid design is what gets me going every day.

                            <h2>What is Hacking?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Computers have become mandatory to run a successful businesses. It is
                                not
                                enough to have isolated computers systems; they need to be networked to
                                facilitate communication with external businesses. This exposes them to
                                the
                                outside world and hacking. Hacking means using computers to commit
                                fraudulent acts such as fraud, privacy invasion, stealing
                                corporate/personal
                                data, etc.
                                <br><br><br>
                                Cyber crimes cost many organizations millions of dollars every
                                year. Businesses need to protect themselves against such attacks.
                                Hacking is identifying weakness in computer systems or networks to
                                exploit
                                its weaknesses to gain access. Example of Hacking: Using password
                                cracking
                                algorithm to gain access to a system <br><br><br>

                                Adrian Lamo decided to switch careers when he realized the potentials of his skills. He
                                became a news when he hacked into Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google, and The New York

                                Richard Pryce did, could have triggered great many issues between USA and North Korea.
